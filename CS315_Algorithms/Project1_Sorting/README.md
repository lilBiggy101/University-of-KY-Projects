This is my first project for my algorithms class. It had me using 3 sorting methods (Insertion sort, Quick sort, and Merge sort) to sort a file of video game titles based on the amount of money the games made. To run my code compile it with g++ sorting.cpp -o Sorting and run it by doing ./sorting gamesRandomSortedLarge.csv
